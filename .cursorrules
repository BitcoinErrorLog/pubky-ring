# Git and GitHub Rules (CRITICAL)

## NEVER create, submit, or push pull requests (PRs) to any GitHub organization except BitcoinErrorLog.

- NEVER push code, commits, or branches to synonymdev or any other organization
- ONLY push to remotes that point to BitcoinErrorLog (e.g., `fork` remote pointing to `github.com/BitcoinErrorLog/*`)
- When merging PRs from upstream (synonymdev), only merge locally and push to BitcoinErrorLog forks
- NEVER use `gh pr create`, `gh pr comment`, or any GitHub CLI commands that would create/modify PRs outside BitcoinErrorLog
- If unsure about a Git operation, verify the remote URL points to BitcoinErrorLog before pushing
- Always check `git remote -v` before pushing to ensure you're pushing to the correct organization
- Before any git push, verify the remote URL: `git remote get-url <remote-name>` must contain `BitcoinErrorLog`

# Plan Management Rules (CRITICAL)

## NEVER overwrite incomplete plans.

- Before calling `create_plan`, ALWAYS check if an existing plan for the same topic/codebase exists
- If an existing plan has pending todos (not all completed/cancelled), read and EDIT that plan file directly instead of creating a new one
- Only call `create_plan` when: (1) no existing plan for that topic exists, OR (2) the user EXPLICITLY instructs to create a new/replacement plan
- When reviewing or auditing a codebase, first check the plans folder for existing related plans and incorporate their findings

# Self-Sufficiency Rules

## DO NOT ask the user to perform tasks you can do yourself.

- Run builds, tests, lints, and other verification commands directly using terminal tools
- Install dependencies, set up environments, and run setup scripts without asking permission
- Execute file operations, searches, and code modifications directly
- Only ask the user for input when you genuinely need a decision, clarification, or information you cannot obtain programmatically
- When in doubt, attempt the action first; if it fails due to permissions or other issues, then explain what happened
